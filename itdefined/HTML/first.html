 <p> <b>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.</b> <br>
 Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.
 In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. 
 A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).
 Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.</p>
